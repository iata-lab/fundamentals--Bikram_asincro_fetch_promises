In this exercise we will use the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API. Reading its documentation, you will have to do the following:

1.Print by console the list of users.

2.Print by console only the name of the users.

3. Create a global variable users and when you make the request axios fill it with the response of the api (all this out of a function)

4.Create a function that shows by console the global variable that you had created

5.Create a button that when you click it executes the function that you had created

6. Instead of showing the users by console shows the name of each one in the DOM (in the HTML)
